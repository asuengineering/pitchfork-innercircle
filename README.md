# Inner Circle (a [Pitchfork](https://github.com/asuengineering/pitchfork) child theme)

**Find us online at [https://innercircle.engineering.asu.edu](https://innercircle.engineering.asu.edu)**

The Inner Circle child theme for ASU Engineering is our web solution to provide community-driven events information to the engineering students at-large.

It contains features and documentation allowing end users the ability to provide a complete landing page for their event or post as well as a unique mechanism to integrate that information into the central Inner Circle calendar. 

All submissions to Inner Circle are currated by members of the ASU MarComm team. Without their tireless efforts, this site wouldn't be possible.

This plugin adds blocks and block patterns for the new block editor. Designs are consistent with the ASU Unity Design system for web standards.

### Release Notes

#### Version 1.3

- Adjustments to block styles for better presentation on constructed pages (like the home page.)
- Introduction of error handling proceedures due to lack of availability of ACF form validation within the block editor. Resolves several scenarios in which fatal errors could be produced on single.php and calendar.php pages.

#### Version 1.2

- Converted theme to work with Pitchfork as the parent theme as opposed to UDS-WordPress. Better for page creation, better integration with Pitchfork Docs.

#### Version 1.1

- Stable version released to Pantheon, pre-production, for testing.
